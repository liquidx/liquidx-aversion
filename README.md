aversion.one codebase

This project is for hosting vibe-coded prototypes.
Each prototype is linked from the front page and then self contained within a Svelte component in src/lib/components/Aversion[name].svelte.

# Prototypes

## Metro

[Metro](/metro) is a subway map editor where you can add stations and create train lines.

The app works in several modes.

- In Line mode, click to drop stations on the map. Click on the station to select it, once selected the station can be moved around, renamed, color can be changed and the position of the label can be edited.

- In Station mode, click on multiple stations to select. Use the link stations button to create a new line. Selecting a line itself will allow changing the color and other attributes of the line
